### Greetings and salutations ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GithHub page. I'm Virginia, a budding software engineer. After beginning my career in finance, I decided to make a switch and enrolled in coding bootcamp - shoutout Tech Elevator! The rest is, as they say, history. I'm a full stack developer just getting my start in the industry.
